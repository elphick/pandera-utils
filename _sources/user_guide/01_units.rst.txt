Unit of Measure
===============

The unit of measure for a column is often ignored in the interest of progress.
However, once you have made the right decision to manage your dataset with a pandera schema, why not
simply document what units your column contains?

No specific functionality is added to the schema by specifying the unit of measure, but it can be useful.
It can potentially be appended to the description and added to your profile reports.
